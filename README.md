Kakalika Issue Tracker
======================

A simple issue management tool for small teams. The goal behind 
kakalika is to provide an issue managment tool that is easy to setup, easy to
administer and easy to use. It is meant to be that kind of tool that anyone can
figure out in just a few clicks. 

Although kakalika is currently in its infancy and is obviously quite far from 
what it is actually supposed to be, it still packs a little punch. For now you
can: 
- Log your issues (that's why its an issue tracker)
- Give your issues statuses with our simple built in workflow
- Categorize all your issues with our built in categories
- Comment on issues and keep track of all the history of comments

See INSTALL.md for more information on how to install kakalika.
